I want to tell a little story about my current situation, I wont say much but this is about my life relation. I don't mind writing this because this is like my life diary. So I just undergo a breakup (A pretty hard one). But it's for a good cause. I want to really focus on my life and keep getting bigger everyday upping my value as a person. So that's it. I am still pretty sad but I am sure that I can recover soon.
